<!-- description -->

**Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B)** is a surveillance technology and form of Electronic [Conspicuity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_collision_avoidance_system#Aircraft_collision_avoidance) in which an [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft) determines its position via [satellite navigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_navigation) or other sensors and periodically broadcasts it, enabling it to be tracked.
